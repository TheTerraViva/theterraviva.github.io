### About

Hello and welcome!

My name is Lotem Taylor and I am the sole proprietor of Terra Viva. I offer GIS and data science services to better inform conservation amidst global environmental change. I map spatial patterns, manage large datasets, and scale up analyses with automated workflows. I enjoy developing new approaches and continuing to expand my skillset.

I founded Terra Viva in 2023 after a decade of experience in academic, governmental, and non-profit sectors, including work with the National Audubon Society, Peninsula Open Space Trust, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Bartolome and Brashares Groups at UC Berkeley.

I am excited to work with you. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or requests.
