## GIS and Data Science for the Living Planet

## {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### About

Hello and welcome! My name is Lotem Taylor and I am the sole proprietor of Terra Viva LLC. I offer GIS and data science services to better inform biological conservation amidst global change. I often work in R to analyze spatial patterns, manage large datasets, and scale up analyses with automated workflows. I enjoy developing new approaches and continuing to expand my technical skillset.

I founded my company after nearly a decade of experience in academic, governmental, and non-profit sectors, including work with the National Audubon Society, Peninsula Open Space Trust, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Bartolome and Brashares Groups at UC Berkeley.

I would be excited to work with you on any project that fits my skillset. Please let me know if I can be of service to you or if you have any other questions.

### Credits

I strongly believe in open access data and code. I built my website in R Markdown with the **[Bootswatch Simplex Theme](https://bootswatch.com/simplex/)**. All code, images, and icons are publicly available.

The background image of my website is **[Laguna San Rafael National Park Viewed from the Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/laguna-san-rafael-national-park-viewed-from-the-space-station)** from NASA.

All icons were created by Pixel Perfect and are freely available at **[Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/pixel-perfect)**.
