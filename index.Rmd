## GIS and Data Science for the Living Planet

## {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### About

Hello and welcome! My name is Lotem Taylor and I am the sole proprietor of Terra Viva LLC. I offer GIS and data science services to better inform biological conservation amidst global change. I often work in R to analyze spatial patterns, manage large datasets, and scale up analyses with automated workflows. I enjoy developing new approaches and continuing to expand my technical skillset.

I founded my company after nearly a decade of experience in academic, governmental, and non-profit sectors. My past work includes hemispheric bird conservation with the National Audubon Society, regional land conservation with the Peninsula Open Space Trust, fish conservation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and wildlife research with the Bartolome and Brashares Groups at UC Berkeley.

I would be excited to work with you on any project that fits my skillset. Please let me know if I can be of service to you or if you have any other questions.
