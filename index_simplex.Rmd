### About

Hello and welcome! My name is Lotem Taylor and I am the sole proprietor of Terra Viva LLC. I offer GIS and data science services to better inform biological conservation amidst global change. I analyze spatial patterns, manage large datasets, and scale up analyses with automated workflows. I enjoy developing new approaches and continuing to expand my technical skillset.

I founded my company after nearly a decade of experience in academic, governmental, and non-profit sectors, including work with the National Audubon Society, Peninsula Open Space Trust, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Bartolome and Brashares Groups at UC Berkeley.

I would be excited to work with you on any project that fits my skillset. Please let me know if I can be of service to you or if you have any other questions.
